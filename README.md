# MetArea
MetArea tool proposes to use the performance calculation to detect functionally related motifs of transcription factor (TF) binding sites in genomic DNA derived from ChIP-seq experiments. MetArea means the Meta Area under curve approach for predicting structural variability and cooperative binding of TFs in ChIP-seq data. Relation of function of two motifs may be interpreted as two structurally distinct motifs of the same TF, if two TFs are distinct then in a mutiprotein complex (e.g. heterodimer) there is a substitute not only for motif but also for TF with its motif. 

# Description
For a model of TF binding sites motif recognition, the recognition accuracy is calculated as the partial area under ROC curve (pAUC, [Tsukanov et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.938545)). The term ROC means Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. Generalizing the ROC curves and pAUC values of the two separate motif models to a single joint motif model reveals whether the joint performance of two motifs competes with those of the participating motifs. Testing multiple possible combinations of motifs allows to detect pairs of motifs most strongly reinforcing each other. The tested motifs can represent either structurally different types of binding sites for the same TF, or binding sites of different TFs acting as part of a single multi-protein complex. Since the default option of TFs action is mutual cooperative interactions, the single protein complex of multiple TFs is reflected in various portions of peaks as different enriched motifs. Hence, the functional relationship of these distinct motifs is recognized through increased recognition performance in pairwise combinations of enriched motifs compared to single motifs. Thus, MetArea predicts motifs with functionally related functions in gene transcription regulation. The criterion of common function for the pair of motifs 1 and 2 requires the higher value pAUC1&2 of accuracy of the joint model 1&2 compared to the accuracy values of both participating motif models, pAUC1 and pAUC2, This criterion of the functionally related motif pair requires that the growth of the common performance: the ration pAUC(1&2) / Max(pAUC1, pAUC2) exceeds one. MetArea considers ready ROC curves for TF binding site motif recognition models, thereby it can be applied to the motifs either of the traditional model of Position Weight Matrix (PWM) or an alternative model, e.g. [SiteGA](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/sitega). 

# Algorithm
MetArea algorithm considers a single set of ChIP-seq peaks, and starts from computation of two ROC curves for each of two combined motif models. The can correspond to various structural types of motifs for the same TF, or motifs for two distinct TFs. The ROC curve represents the relationship between the rates of true positive (TP) and false positive (FP) predictions. For each recognition threshold, the TP rate denotes the fraction of nucleotide sequences from the foreground set (ChIP-seq peaks) containing predicted sites of a motif model. For each recognition threshold, the FP rate is defined as the frequency of the motif in the background set of nucleotide sequences ([Tsukanov et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.938545)). The background set means genomic sequences with A/T content matching that for the sequences from the foreground set, details in [AntiNoise](https://denovosea.icgbio.ru/antinoise/) [(Raditsa et al., 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqae090). Preliminary, for each motif model, the promoter sequences of protein coding genes from whole genomes are used to compute -Log10(ERR) values (Expected Recognition Rate, ERR). These ERR values measure various motif models in the uniform scale ([Levitsky et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz800); [Tsukanov et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.938545)). Thus, in terms of the FP rate computed through ERR values, for any pair of sites of two models we can estimate which of two sites respects higher affinity. 

Next, MetArea algorithm computes the joint ROC curve for the combination of two motif models. The joint TP rate is determined in the same way as TP rates for single motifs. The joint TP rate is the fraction of sequences containing predicted sites of at least one of two motif models. The joint FP rate is not a simple sum of FP rates of two combined motif models. The joint FP rate requires the correction since predicted sites of two motif models may overlap each other in a nucleotide sequence. In particular, following the methodology of [MCOT](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz800) only the following three different cases are possible in one DNA sequence for two sites of two distinct motif models: 
- two sites are located with a spacer since they do not overlap;
- two sites have the full overlap, i.e. one of them is located entirely inside the other;
- two sites have only a partial overlap, this means that when two sites overlap, neither site can be completely located within the other site.

Correspondingly, MetArea proposes the following approach to correct the joint FP rate for the joint motif model:
- if two sites of two models do not overlap, then the joint FP rate increases additively by the impact of two, dFP = 2, two distinct sites in a sequence are detected;
- if these two sites possess the full overlap, then the joint FP rate increases only by the impact of one, dFP = 1, only one site in a sequence is detected;
- if two sites show the partial overlap, then the joint FP rate increases the non-integer impact between one and two (1 < dFP < 2), depending on the ratios between the overlap length (L) of two motifs, and the lengths of motifs W1 and W2, dFP = (L/W1 + L/W2)/2 = L*(W1 + W2)/(W1*W2)/2.

The cases of full or partial overlaps imply that the joint FP rate possesses the best estimate of ERR for two sites, -Log10(ERR1&2) = Max( -Log10(ERR1),  -Log10(ERR2)). 

To differentiate significantly similar pairs of motifs among analyzed pairs of PWM motifs, for all pairs of PWM motifs the significance of similarity is estimated by the motif similarity approach from [MCOT, (Levitsky et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz800)

# Input data

- FASTA file for the set of foreground sequences (peaks). This set represents top-scored peaks derived from ChIP-seq experiment (for example, 1000 peaks of the best quality is the default recomended option).
- FASTA file for the set background sequences. This set consisted of sequences extracted from the whole genome for the respective species, use the [AntiNoise](https://denovosea.icgbio.ru/antinoise/) to generate background sequences matching in the content of A/T nucleotides the sequences from the foreground dataset. Use the default either genomic or promoters options. These options mean extraction of background sequences from the whole genome or only from promoter regions of all protein coding genes. Do not use the shuffled sequences or any other sequences generated by Markov models of different orders as the background set, this drastically reduces the quality of the output results.
- Two distinct motif models, e.g. Position Frequency Matrices (PFM) representing PWM motifs.
- Two lists of recognition thresholds for two motif models and the respective ERR values. These lists are computated as the recognition score distributions for the set of whole-genome promoter sequences selected for the respective species, as it was described earlier for [MCOT](https://webmcot.sysbio.cytogen.ru/) [(Levitsky et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz800) and [SiteGA](https://github.com/parthian-sterlet/sitega) [(Tsukanov et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.938545).
