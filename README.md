# metarea
MetArea means meta area under curve computation for cooperative transcription factor binding in ChIP-seq data.

Generalisation of the recognition accuracy estimation for pairs of motifs, calculated as the area under curve, allows to define such a common accuracy for various combinations of motifs. Hence increase of this common measure points to synergetic actions of certain pairs of motifs.
